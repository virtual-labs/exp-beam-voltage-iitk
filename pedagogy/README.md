#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Animation and Real image
###### Assessment Method: summative

<u> <b>Description: </b> of how you are going to implement the above Instructional Strategy in your Simulator: </u>
<br>
 Real images will be used for the corresponding voltage condition wherein the student will practice using animation control

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.|  Student will understand<br> the image quality depending on the beam voltage | 1. Simulator enables perform<br> the imaging at different voltages  | 1. To educate<br> the requirements of the sample
2.|  Student will understand<br> the charging effect and the importance of conductivity |2. Charging effect will be highlighted for insulating samples  | 2. To educate the importance of operating voltage

<h4>Steps of simulator</h4>
                        1. Follow the standard operating procedure of SEM as learnt earlier.<br>
                        2.	Select the conducting sample and observe the changes that are brought with change in the accelerating voltage. <br>
                        3.	Compare the description of features that a high magnification provides, which may be unseen in lower magnification images.<br>
                        4.	See the level of resolution (finest features that can be obtained), and to what magnification clear images (of conducting samples) can be obtained.<br>
                        5.	Now, observe the changes that are brought when a high kV (say 20 kV) is used for imaging insulating samples (say ceramic or polymeric)<br>
                        6.	Compare the loss in resolution when the magnification is increased. It is because of high beam energy concentrating at smaller area (and conduction of electrons at that rate is not supported). <br>
                        7.	Observe the images when a lower kV (say 5 kV) is used for imaging.<br>
                        8.	Appreciate the charging in the samples when high kV is used, and that the imaging becomes better at low kV<br>
                        9.	In polymeric samples, first, look at zoomed up image, and when the magnification is lowered, a black region develops that is indication of ‘beam-damage’. <br>
